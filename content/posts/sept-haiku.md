# Haiku: September

**Sun, 2024.09.01**

Plans shifted, we roamed

Stroll around Harajuku

Gossip spiced the night


**Mon, 2024.09.02**

Exhaustive efforts

Impact seems so minimal

Dissatisfaction


**Tue, 2024.09.03**

Yesterday’s work blues

Maybe I just need a break

Summer trip ahead


**Wed, 2024.09.04**

Thought I'd find some rest

But there’s more work than I thought

Sigh, no ease today


**Thu, 2024.09.05**

Five months of effort

Project's end is close at hand

Validation soothes


**Fri, 2024.09.06**

Leading felt awkward

But I'll push through discomfort

Learning never ends


**Sat, 2024.09.07**

Behind strength, unknown

A side I didn’t expect

Each has their burden


**Sun, 2024.09.08**

Looked up to their lives

Now I see a different light

Mom and Dad were right


**Mon, 2024.09.09**

Final review done

A smooth end to our hard work

Leader praised the team


**Tue, 2024.09.10**

With tasks all wrapped up

My laughter comes easily

Eager for next month


**Wed, 2024.09.11**

**Thu, 2024.09.12**

**Fri, 2024.09.13**

**Sat, 2024.09.14**

**Wed, 2024.09.18**

**Thu, 2024.09.19**

Onsen noon to night

Relax in comfort and peace

Then shinkansen home


**Fri, 2024.09.20**

Returned home last night

Rest body and gather thoughts

Holidays to breathe


**Sat, 2024.09.21**

Woke late, cooked and napped

Watched J-drama, sang at home

1 a.m. showered


**Sun, 2024.09.22**

Resting at home today

Practiced speaking, learned my gaps

Hyougen and kanji


**Mon, 2024.09.23**

Senzokuike

First walk here after two years

Tamagawa next


**Tue, 2024.09.24**

First day back at work

Just research, writing, and talks

Already want rest


**Wed, 2024.09.25**
