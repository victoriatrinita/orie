**Sat, 2024.06.01**

It is the weekend
But I am in bed all day
That time of the month

**Sun, 2024.06.02**

I woke up past eight
Went weak but came home recharged
Friends in God give strength

**Mon, 2024.06.03**

In a foreign tongue
I struggle, making no sense
Belittled, I thrive

**Tue, 2024.06.04**

Struggling but heard
For the patience, I thank you
Mutual respect

**Wed, 2024.06.05**

Creampuff for breakfast
Craved the sweet, body then slumped
Regret, lesson learned

**Thu, 2024.06.06**

Ages since last book
Skeptic of tech books, found out
basics stay timeless

**Fri, 2024.06.07**

Twenty-four, but still
so much to achieve and see
Fear of thirties looms

**Sat, 2024.06.08**

Saturdays at home
Neglected tasks find their end
Outdoors calls next week

**Sun, 2024.06.09**

Once more, heartfelt talks,
Love shared like in days before,
With dear mom, tonight.

**Mon, 2024.06.10**

Old man's wisdom, guide,
Past five, to own goals we stride,
Towards dreams, we work

**Tue, 2024.06.11**

Observe my own steps
Sorting what works, what does not
Life's mess slowly clears

**Wed, 2024.06.12**

Day's tasks neatly done
Yet evening whispers of rest
Tasks slip with the night

**Thu, 2024.06.13**

Work sails, smooth and sure,
Tasks meet time, past struggles fade
With experience gained

**Fri, 2024.06.14**

Late wake-up, sleepy
Weariness lingers all day
Film with dear, unwind
