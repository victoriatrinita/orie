## Haiku: July

**Mon, 2024.07.01**

Video shook me

Life's fragility felt

Health worries arise


**Tue, 2024.07.02**

Caught the bus in rush

Card reader fails, I step off

Avoid past mistake


**Wed, 2024.07.03**

Lying if I said

I did not think of it all day

Chest lump found last night


**Thu, 2024.07.04**

_Jin dan Jun_ at night

2000s Indonesian show

Kindergarten days


**Fri, 2024.07.05**

Mom shared a big news

Sister's expecting—soon aunt

Joy, yet feeling old


**Sat, 2024.07.06**

Yesterday it came

Monthly cycle—maybe linked

Hope the lump will shrink


**Sun, 2024.07.07**

Japanese test day

Reading tough, listening fine

Overall, quite hard


**Mon, 2024.07.08**

Hot air all around

Sausage waits in office fridge

Forgot to bring home


**Tue, 2024.07.09**

WFH today

Light tasks, life tidied just okay

A calm, simple day


**Wed, 2024.07.10**

Health check-up secured

Relief and hope intertwined

Praying all is well


**Thu, 2024.07.11**

**Fri, 2024.07.12**

**Sat, 2024.07.13**

**Sun, 2024.07.14**

Church folks inquire

About my job’s challenges

Surprised by their concern


**Mon, 2024.07.15**

Sea day turned to hills

Waterfall's coolness felt good

Church friends' warmth, unmatched


**Tue, 2024.07.16**

Health check, half workday

Bought breads from the station shop

Results in a week


**Wed, 2024.07.17**

Worked from home today

Routine, nothing much to note

Made hiking poster


**Thu, 2024.07.18**

Social gathering

HR’s effort to connect

Grateful for their care


**Fri, 2024.07.19**

Talked about our path

Decisions take time to make

Not an easy choice


**Sat, 2024.07.20**

Youth service, then dine

Seated with quiet people

Awkward, few words shared


**Sun, 2024.07.21**

Girls karaoke

Their voices loud, mine is weak

Must practice my voice


**Mon, 2024.07.22**

**Tue, 2024.07.23**

**Wed, 2024.07.24**

**Thu, 2024.07.25**

Worked til 4am

Three hours of sleep by choice

Should get paid more still
